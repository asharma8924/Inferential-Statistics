The plot gives the impression that the sample averages are roughly normally
distributed, with some tail variation from normality.

A gauge of the precision of the confidence interval method is the percentage of
confidence intervals that contain the true mean. The ratio must be very nearly
0.95, which is the confidence level in this circumstance. The confidence intervals
may be too broad, indicating that the approach is not precise enough, if the
proportion is significantly lower than the confidence level. The confidence
intervals may be excessively close together if the proportion is significantly higher
than the confidence level, which shows that the technique may be unduly
pessimistic.If the confidence interval approach is operating properly in our
scenario, we would anticipate the percentage of confidence intervals containing
the true mean to be close to 0.95. If the proportion deviates significantly from
0.95, there may be problems with the methodology or the sample size.

It is important to keep in mind that the t-test requires that the sample size is
sufficient for the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to be applicable. No matter how the
underlying population is distributed, according to the CLT, the distribution of
sample means is generally normal under specific circumstances.
